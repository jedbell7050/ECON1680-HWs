# Jupyter Notebook Instructions

You are expected to create your own Jupyter Notebook based on the information in the HW3.docx. This means you should copy and paste the questions from HW3.docx into the notebook, fill in your text answers, and then also provide your code in code blocks with the output displayed. For submitting to Canvas, you must save the notebook as a pdf with the outputs visible. Please see the TA if you have questions on this.

# Separate Python and Answer File Instructions
This will be the same as Homeworks 1 and 2. You are expected to create your own .py file from scratch and comment your code, and write out your text answers in the word document. Please submit both the .py file and .docx file to Github and submit a .pdf of your word document and code to Canvas.
